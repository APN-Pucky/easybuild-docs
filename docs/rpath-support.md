# Support for RPATH

!!! warning
    This page will soon replace <https://docs.easybuild.io/en/latest/RPATH-support.html>.

    **
    It still needs to be ported from *reStructuredText* (.rst) to *MarkDown* (.md),  
    and you can help with that!
    **

    - source: [`docs/RPATH-support.rst` in `easybuilders/easybuild` repo](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/easybuilders/easybuild/develop/docs/RPATH-support.rst)
    - target: [`docs/rpath-support.md` in `easybuilders/easybuild-docs` repo](https://github.com/easybuilders/easybuild-docs/tree/main/docs/rpath-support.md)
